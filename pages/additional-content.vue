	<p>We need to identify local experts in each of the topics listed above, involve them meetings and organization as much as possible, so that they can answer questions at town halls, provide reliable information, and guide the revision and expansion of the GND towards the achievement of realistic, immediate goals.</p>

	<p>(Federally focused) This study discusses how we can create over one million decent jobs in the public sector.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>(Federally focused) “As many as 18,000 jobs are created for every $1 billion of investment in energy conservation and renewable energy systems. The average renewable energy investment creates four times as many jobs as the same investment in the fossil fuel economy.” Study</p>

	<p>(Federally focused) This Columbia Institute study found that Canada can create 3.9 million direct jobs with net zero building retrofits and new “green” commercial, industrial, and institutional building construction: building small district energy systems, building an almost completely renewable energy grid by 2050, and expanding and improving our public transportation systems.</p>

	<p>(Federally focused) This comprehensive study demonstrates the feasibility of federal free tuition and provides progressive fundraising mechanisms for presentation from a fiscally conservative.</p>

	<p>(Provincially focused) The 18,000 jobs per $1 billion of investment does not just apply to one area. Such investments can be done on a provincial basis, with paid student jobs and internships made a priority. Our engineering students and research infrastructure can easily be applied to a Green New Deal program.</p>

	<p>Worker cooperatives are employee-owned businesses in which decisions are made democratically: one worker, one vote. Worker coops are an innovative model of keeping wealth local and incomes high, while ensuring the energy grid of the future is accountable to the community.</p>

	<p>(Federally focused) This comprehensive <a href="https://cfs-fcee.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CFS-TimeToThinkBIG-Web-EN.pdf">study</a> demonstrates the feasibility of federal free tuition and provides progressive fundraising mechanisms for presentation from a fiscally conservative.</p>

	<li>
	<p>(Provincially focused) Free tuition is ideal for the facilitation of a Green New Deal program. Consider this <a href="https://cfs-fcee.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CFS-TimeToThinkBIG-Web-EN.pdf">study</a> (p. 15) which finds that total public education (college, vocational, university all included) revenue amounts to about $918 million. The province can pass legislation mandating the elimination of tuition fees for students that go to public institutions. How it <a href="https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2019/04/04/just-the-facts-checking-ndp-leader-rachel-notleys-election-stump-statements.html">could</a> be <strong>paid for</strong> would be for an increase in corporate taxes of between 1.5-2%, using the following <a href="https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2019/04/04/just-the-facts-checking-ndp-leader-rachel-notleys-election-stump-statements.html">information</a>: “The NDP says that corporate taxes generate $316 million per tax point…” &amp; “the net reduction from 2001-2006, when the corporate tax rate dropped by 5.5 per cent, saw the province lose $3.7 billion.”</p>
