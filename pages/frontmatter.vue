<p>The CO2 in the atmosphere <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/12/co2-in-the-atmosphere-just-exceeded-415-parts-per-million-for-the-first-time-in-human-history/"><span class="underline">has already exceeded 415 ppm</a>: “the point of no return.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the IPCC <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report"><span class="underline">report</a>, carbon emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030 from 2010 levels; we’d need to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 if we want to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees. Without it? We could see global temperatures increase by 4<sup>o</sup>C <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/news/co2-hits-new-high-world-could-warm-7f-by-2060-15268"><span class="underline">as early as 2060.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oil Sands emissions reporting was incorrect; our current numbers put Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions over <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/oilsands-carbon-emissions-study-1.5106809"><span class="underline">2 times</a> what it was originally thought to be.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Alberta &amp; Saskatchewan are uniquely responsible for preventing Canada from meeting Copenhagen and Paris emissions goals, and has <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/05/27/analysis/surprise-most-canada-track-hit-our-2020-climate-target"><span class="underline">increased emissions as the rest of the country has reduced them.</a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The people most affected by climate change &amp; environmental destruction are the least responsible for emissions, including Indigenous communities in North America and the global south, marginalized populations, people of color, women, children, working people, and the poor.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Indigenous peoples’ traditional food sources are being contaminated, with skyrocketing cancer rates [<a href="https://landuse.alberta.ca/Forms%20and%20Applications/RFR_ACFN%20Reply%20to%20Crown%20Submission%206%20-%20TabD11%20Report_2014-08_PUBLIC.pdf"><span class="underline">AB study</a>].</p>

<p>The oil &amp; gas industry has gutted northern BC First Nations’ economies &amp; ecosystems. This Amnesty International <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/02/climate-change-will-create-worlds-biggest-refugee-crisis"><span class="underline">report</a> also looks at the intersection of gender and the flawed consultation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The incessant assaults on Indigenous sovereignty by pipeline and other dirty infrastructure development. Two prominent and pressing examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The invasion of the Wet’suwet’en First Nation for the Coastal Gas Link pipeline (clans <a href="http://unistoten.camp/"><span class="underline">Unist'ot'en</a> and <a href="https://www.yintahaccess.com/notrespass"><span class="underline">Gidimt’en</a>)</p>

</ul></li>
<li>
<p>The number of Indigenous communities’ receiving drinking water advisories has <a href="https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/j5da9g/fact-check-indigenous-water-crisis-isnt-improving-despite-promises-from-trudeau"><span class="underline">increased</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Canadian government knew about Grassy Narrows’ mercury poisoning <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/11/11/ontario-knew-about-mercury-site-near-grassy-narrows-for-decades-but-kept-it-secret.html"><span class="underline">since the 1960s</a>, but kept it secret. It still has done next to nothing. The poisoning came from the dumping of a corporation.</p>

<p>Climate change caused by the wealthiest people amounts to <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2015/10/05/climate-change-migration-is-genocide-says-marshall-islands-minister/"><span class="underline">genocidal</a> activity.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Oil &amp; Gas industry is not above criticism</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Their responsibility should be to the people and the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oil &amp; Gas industry success does not guarantee its workers will be successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boom and Bust oil-patch economics harm Canadian families.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The industry has controlled economic &amp; ecological narratives around climate change</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Fossil-Fuel Industry is uniquely responsible for obstuficating and challenging attempts to convert to green energy.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Market-based solutions will not save us.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Carbon trading is a <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/04/20/ets-rip"><span class="underline">failure</a>. Even if maximally implemented, energy corporations always lobby aggressively to exploit its structure, or water it down to impotence.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Canada was <a href="https://ipolitics.ca/2018/01/02/drilldown-canada-not-track-meet-paris-climate-goals/"><span class="underline">not on track</a> to meeting Paris climate targets, let alone the goals outlined in the latest IPCC report.</p>

<li>
<p>Alberta is <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/alberta-reducing-emissions-but-unlikely-to-live-up-to-canadas-climate-change-targets"><span class="underline">not on track</a> to meet federal goals; not under the NDP or IPCC targets.

</li>
<li>
<p>“In British Columbia, which has had a carbon tax since 2008, greenhouse gas emissions are growing faster than the national average. The results are especially bad when it comes to emissions from road transportation. From 2011 to 2016, emissions from on-road vehicles in B.C. soared 19.3% compared to the national average of 2.9% during the same period, despite a $30-per tonne carbon tax.” <a href="https://winnipegsun.com/opinion/columnists/brodbeck-carbon-tax-wont-reduce-emissions"><span class="underline">Article</a></p>

<p>Environmental destruction is expensive and not worth it.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The cost of cleaning up Alberta’s oil patch is estimated to be about <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/2018/11/01/what-would-it-cost-to-clean-up-albertas-oilpatch-260-billion-a-top-official-warns.html"><span class="underline">$260 billion</a>.
