<h1 id="housing">Housing</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Housing is an essential human right, one that is neglected in Canada. This section of the Maximum GND focuses on ensuring sustainable, affordable access to housing for everyone. The following data and proposals demonstrate that ecological well-being and housing security are common goals and need to be emphasized in any complete GND.</p>
<h3 id="retrofitting-and-constructing-green-homes">Retrofitting and Constructing Green Homes</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Data</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>“Building the Retrofit Economy,” a report commissioned by Ecology North, shows how retrofitting all the buildings in the NWT to more energy-efficient standards would actually generate revenue from fuel savings. This revenue could be put towards labor, training, construction expenses, and renewable energy for retrofitting buildings.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Housing accounts for 40% of carbon emissions from the urban consumption sector indifferent of housing density, identifying the need for more energy efficient buildings.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LED lighting is 75% more energy efficient and lasts 25 times longer than traditional incandescent bulbs.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain building materials have carbon-sequestering properties, such as hempcrete. Hempcrete is a renewable alternative to traditional building materials that hardens as it sequesters carbon, providing improved insulation and carbon sequestration over time.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using recycled car tires packed in adobe mud has been shown to be a safe, affordable, and sustainable building material when compared to traditional non-renewable construction materials.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p>Proposals</p>

<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>
<p>Undertake standard efficiency retrofits to improve operational performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undertake deep retrofits to high performance standards, focusing on carbon reduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate Solar or other on site renewable energy systems in buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to low carbon fuel sources in buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ban incandescent bulbs and replace burnt-out bulbs with LEDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incentivising the usage of green materials in housing construction, such as hempcrete, or recycled materials, such as shredded car tires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incentivising the building of green roofs in housing construction (see the Food Security section).</p>

<p>Data</p>

<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>
<p>In the UK, community land trusts are nonprofit institutions that reduce the downpayment of a house by having the Trust buy land beneath a house and then hold it in trust for the commons. Members pay rent to the Trust and use the land in common with other renters (see pg 67 of “Land For The Many”).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nordic countries such as Sweden have “right of public access” or “everyman’s right” guaranteed in their constitution, ensuring that everyone has the right to use uncultivated land so long as one does not cause land degradation, disturb wildlife, or remain longer than 24 hours.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p>Proposals</p>

<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>
<p>Create community land trusts and give them adequate funds to buy available land around rural areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make land ownership data more transparent and available to foster community led land acquisition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish democratic land councils that are answerable to the public rather than private land development companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enshrine the right to roam across all uncultivated land and water.</p>

<p>Data</p>

<ol start="19" type="1">
<li>
<p>As of 2016, 1.35 million homes in Canada are vacant or temporarily occupied, 8.7% of the total number of homes.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Canadians spent more than 30% of their income on housing. Canadians would have to make $22.40/h to afford an average two-bedroom apartment or $20.20/h to afford an average one-bedroom apartment.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over half of all Calgarians struggle to afford food and shelter.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approximately 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness each year. Shelter occupancy rose from 82% to 92% between 2005 and 2014.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given soaring rent prices coupled with over 66,000 unoccupied homes, Vancouver implemented a ghost-tax for unoccupied dwellings. The scheme, projected to produce $30 million in tax revenue annually for the city, targeted 8,500 dwellings. However, it seems that the tax has done little to decrease rent problems in the city, likely due to the high demand and the small number of dwellings targeted.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zoning regulations in North America are the direct result of racial segregation in the United States, with white families living in affluent low-density suburban neighborhoods and black families living in poor high-density urban neighborhoods.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urban Habitat filed a lawsuit against the City of Pleasanton, California for exclusionary housing policies that disproportionately affected non-white wage workers. The low-density housing in the city was unaffordable for workers, forcing nearly 90% of workers to commute from outside the city, generating huge amounts of greenhouse gases. In 2012, the lawsuit was settled and Pleasanton built 500 units of affordable housing, put in two rapid transit stations, and passed anti-discrimation housing legislation that rezoned suburban housing areas.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Co-op housing in Canada are more cost-effective (14% less) to operate than non-profit housing. Co-ops strongly benefit women, with 58% of co-op housing residents being women and half of all co-op housing households being either single females or single-female parents.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rent control loopholes were closed in Ontario, capping rent increases at the rate of inflation and no more than 2.5% to combat ballooning housing prices.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gentrification in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside has endangered social housing, putting thousands of Vancouverites at risk of displacement and homelessness, particularly those affected by drug and alcohol addiction. This gentrification is driven by a mixture of aggressive condo-development, civic corruption, and disproportionate over-policing of the Downtown Eastside.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since 1981, Alpha House has existed in Calgary as a safe place to help people with alcohol and drug addictions access addiction-related healthcare and housing. Due to gentrification of the area, there has been a push by new residents to move the Alpha House, which could displace the detox residents that need healthcare and housing.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landlords in Canada use legal loopholes such as “renoviction”to evict tenants that do not comply to rent increases.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Companion animal pets provide numerous health benefits to pet owners including improved cardiovascular health, improved mental health, and increased opportunities for socialization and outdoor activity.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the fact that pets are ubiquitous and are increasingly considered family members, pet owners have poorer housing security than non-owners and are more likely to seek poorer quality housing to accommodate their pets.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inuit communities are in an even deeper housing crisis than other people in Canada, with over 40% of Inuit living in overcrowded housing and one third of Inuit in need of suitable housing, largely due to the absence of public and private housing investment.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One in five trans* people in the US experienced homelessness and 20-40% of homeless youth are LGBT+, largely due to parental rejection and housing discrimination.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p>Proposals</p>

<ol start="35" type="1">
<li>
<p>Implement an aggressive ghost-house tax of greater than 50% to unoccupied homes, with $10,000 fine for each day of a false declaration of occupancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct affordable housing projects in areas where people work in YYC.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Establish rent control without loopholes, fixing rent at the cost of inflation and no more than 2.5%, with exceptions for new developments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End gentrification of low-income housing by stopping upzoning. Special consideration should be given to areas that have homeless shelters and detox programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandate that all rental properties allow renters to have pets. All rentals should allow for at least one dog or cat per residence.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Invest in suitable housing for Inuit people living in Canada’s North and for other indigenous people living in Canada.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure housing protection for LGBT+ youth through establishing queer housing centres in major cities.</p>
