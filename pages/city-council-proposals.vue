	<p><span dir="ltr">Rationale: The purpose of this document is to put forward immediate proposals for Calgary City Council from our comprehensive Green New Deal (hereafter GND). Through these proposals, we hope to foster prosocial, community-building, effective climate action. The following proposals in this document are</span></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr">Feasible: needing small investment in labor and capital.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr">Immediate: can be implemented in one to three years.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr">Local: designed specifically for the YYC area.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<p><span dir="ltr">For more detailed background rationale and data on any of these points, please refer to the Permeate GND documents.</span></p>
	<h2 id="food-security"><span dir="ltr">Food Security</span></h2>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Given that</span></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Climate change will increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, endangering food production.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">30% of all produce is imported into Canada, generating 3.3 million tonnes of CO2 per year.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">One in eight households in Canada is food-insecure.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Food insecurity disproportionately affects already vulnerable people like…</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Women</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Children</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Indigenous people</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">People living alone</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">People with disabilities</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">LGBT2SQIA+ identifying people</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Nine in ten Canadians are worried about food prices.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Food prices are rising by more than 400$ per year.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">The biggest barrier to young farmers is access to land.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">We propose that the City of Calgary</span></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Converting the Transit Utility Corridor for agriculture production.</strong> This currently unused green space is maintained by mowing and herbicide use, costing an estimated $40 million per year. This land could be turned over to the surrounding communities with minimal costs. See a map of the corridor <a href="https://data.calgary.ca/Services-and-Amenities/Transportation-Utility-Corridor/hfu7-u9j5"><span class="underline">here</span></a>.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Incentivizing and allowing the conversion of lawns, boulevards, and unused lots into community garden spaces.</strong> This program would mitigate the issue of garden care for elderly or disabled persons who otherwise cannot maintain their yard space, promote prosocial community organization, and ensure access to nutritious food for the 1 in 8 Calgarians that are food insecure.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Encouraging the development of indoor aquaponics systems throughout Calgary</strong> (such as in the +15 spaces, the University of Calgary, or in Calgary public schools) <strong>through existing municipal grants.</strong> Such systems combine aquatic species (fish, small crustaceans, and various mollusks) with conventional annual crops to produce food, and greatly reduce waste and need for inputs such as fertilizer and water, and chemical filters and additives. It also prevents pollution of local watersheds.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Eliminating barriers to beekeeping.</strong> Restrict the ability of homeowner’s associations and insurance companies to prevent people from beekeeping on their property.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Abolishing the use of chemical pesticides in Calgary public spaces</strong>. These kill pollinators, birds, and amphibians.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Lifting restrictions on urban chicken keeping in Calgary.</strong> Establish a free permit system for up to four hens (no roosters) per suitable sized properties in Calgary following similar programs to Vancouver, Toronto, and Edmonton.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Expanding the current small ruminant weed-management program to include the transit utility corridor and other unused green-spaces in Calgary.</strong> Offer permits and incentives to local goat and sheep producers in and around Calgary to manage these areas.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Offering pilot permits to study the viability of backyard miniature goat keeping in Calgary</strong> along the lines of the Miniature Goats Pilot Project in Saanich, British Columbia.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Establishing protected green belt areas along the periphery of Calgary with corridors for wildlife movement.</strong> These protected areas will discourage further urban expansion and allow living space for wildlife away from the suburban and urban areas. Limiting urban sprawl makes cities easier to access by transit and reduces the use of private single-occupant vehicles.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="housing"><span dir="ltr">Housing</span></h2>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Given that</span></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Housing accounts for 40% of carbon emissions in urban areas.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Retrofitting buildings saves more money in energy costs than it takes to retrofit.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Canadians spend more than 30% of their income on housing.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Over half of Calgarians now struggle to afford food and shelter.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Homeless shelter occupancy rose from 82 to 92 percent from 2005 to 2015.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">We propose that the City of Calgary</span></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Undertake deep retrofits to high performance standards, focusing on carbon reduction and solar microgrid generation.</strong> This will decrease the cost of heating in the long run, create jobs, and decrease city-wide emissions.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Ensure stronger tenant protections and rent controls</strong>. These measures help people stay in their homes, reduce potential future income streams from land and bring tenancy closer to ownership in terms of stability, security and control.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Disincentivize owning unused housing in Calgary through a “ghost tax”.</strong> Individuals who own more than two homes or do not live in their homes in Calgary would pay a substantial tax to help keep housing prices in check.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>End exclusive zoning.</strong> We can carefully dismantle the system of exclusion that maintains a false scarcity of land and keeps significant portions of our cities off limits to renters and workers. At the same time, we should introduce measures to capture any increases in land values to incumbent owners and redirect that money to the public good.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>End gentrification.</strong> Gentrification endangers the most vulnerable housing-insecure individuals, increases crime rates, and increases the cost of living for residents.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Support housing co-ops in Calgary.</strong> Fair taxation and subsidization of co-op housing is strongly beneficial for single mothers and women.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="social-services"><span dir="ltr">Social Services</span></h2>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Given that</span></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Participating in community activities is associated with improved general physical health, mental health, and social well-being.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Putting services within walking and cycling distance would help combat climate change.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Mental healthcare services are critically overburdened in Alberta.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Since water fluoridation has been removed, children are experiencing almost four times the rate of tooth decay.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">We propose that the City of Calgary</span></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Allow child-care service providers to utilize community centres</strong>. Revitalizing community centres with access to daycares would allow parents to go to work and build our community. These services can be streamlined to include elder care services, breaking up age segregation.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Expand counselling services by offering sessions in community centres</strong>. These programs can utilize community gardening therapy to help individuals with depression and anxiety.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Create additional supervised safe-injection sites.</strong> Calgary only has one safe-injection site run out of the Sheldon M. Chumir Centre. More safe injection sites with narcan and clean needles would decrease the number of overdosing and intra-venous transmitted diseases in the city.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Expand housing-oriented shelters</strong>. There are currently not enough places for individuals to sleep at night in a city that can go well below -30<sup>o</sup>C in the winter. This would help prevent cases of frostbite, violence, and substance abuse in individuals with poor access to housing.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Reinstate water fluoridation in the city of Calgary.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="transit"><span dir="ltr">Transit</span></h2>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Given that…</span></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>The most effective way to combat urban sprawl is to improve transit accessibility</strong> which in turn reduces vehicular emissions and the need for space-occupying parking lots.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Transit improves worker commutes, increasing the chances of workers staying employed, and reduces reliance on unemployment insurance.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Improved access to public transit fosters community inclusivity and expands opportunities</strong> for the elderly, students, low income/single income families, tourists/visitors, and the differently abled.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Taking transit is safer than driving private vehicles.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Cycling lanes reduce road fatalities for all users</strong> due to the “calming effect” that bicycle lanes have on automobile traffic.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Better-designed sidewalk systems decrease pedestrian accident rates.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">We propose that we</span></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Expand the free fare zones in Calgary to reduce the use of personal vehicles in Calgary</strong>. Calgary already has partial free transit with the free fare zone downtown. This free fare zone can be expanded to include the major C-train routes throughout the city.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Expand C-Train lines to serve the entire city.</strong> Include C-Train service to end of Memorial, south to Foothills, and to Country Hills (Green Line). Additionally, include C-Train service to surrounding First Nations</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Increase frequency and coverage of municipal bus services.</strong></span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Abolish or restrict non-transit traffic in the downtown core and beltline during peak daytime hours.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Increase the distribution and connectedness of bike lanes, sidewalks, and HOV lanes.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="energy-sector"><span dir="ltr">Energy Sector</span></h2>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Given that</span></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Fossil fuels are <em>the</em> primary cause of climate change.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Reduced spending on energy due to generating energy locally helps keep wealth within the community.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Worker co-ops are more productive than conventional firms and increase employment security for workers.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Solar co-ops generate profit and help communities save on energy costs by up to 20%.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Decarbonization will create millions of new jobs across Canada by 2050.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">The fossil fuel industry today accounts for only 1% of Canadian jobs and 8% of the national GDP.</span></strong></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong><span dir="ltr">We propose that the City of Calgary</span></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Supports the development of sustainable microgrid generation in Calgary</strong> through training programs, tax breaks, rebates, smart meter installation, and a streamlined approval process.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Supports worker’s co-ops in Calgary</strong> through tax breaks, legal information, the right of first-refusal on all company sales or closures, and information on solar microgrid generation.</span></p>
	</blockquote></li>
	<li><blockquote>
	<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Offers retraining opportunities to workers exiting the fossil fuel industry,</strong> particularly through adult education programs and in municipal services with transferable skill-sets.</span></p>
