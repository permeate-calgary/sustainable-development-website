<h2>Engaging Experts</h2>
<ol>
	<li>We need to identify local experts in each of the topics listed above. We need to integrate them into meetings and the organization as much as possible, so that they can answer questions at town halls, provide reliable information, and guide the organization to achieving realistic, immediate goals.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Code of Conduct â€” For the Meeting</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Land acknowledgment</li>
	<li>No recording/tweeting</li>
	<li>Procedure for putting issues aside (pinning them for > later, make a script for that procedure)</li>
	<li>Start with Just Transition (we are not criticizing > grunt workers, they must put food on the table)</li>
	<li>Anthropogenic climate change is real</li>
	<li>Alberta &amp; SASK have highest emissions (not on track > to meeting Paris, which are really low goals), so we have most > responsibility</li>
	<li>Oil &amp; gas industry are not above > criticism/untouchable/neutral (they have political > interests)</li>
	<li>Get rid of assumption that just cause oil does well, > workers do well</li>
	<li>Designate a moderator to redirect conversations that > are not on topic so that we stay on top of the schedule</li>
	<li>Grievances will be documented</li>
	<li>One diva, one mic</li>
